      <h3>About this</h3>
        <p>Do people frequently ask you for help promoting a tech job? Or anything? Let's require some civil rights from the employers and events we help promote.</p>
        <p>Sign your name below and commit to asking employers if they allow LGBT discrimination before agreeing to help them promote anything.</p>
      <h3>Here's what to do</h3>
      <p>If someone asks you to help promote a job opening, event, or anything, you commit to ask...</p>
      <p><strong>"Hey, before I promote your thing, I need to know:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Does your company include LGBT employees in its EEO nondiscrimination policy?</li>
        <li>Does your company offer benefits equally to LGBT employees, their partners, and their dependents? Including comprehensive medical care for Trans employees?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thank you!"</strong></p>
      <p>Or however you want to phrase it. :) <em>Caveat: I work for the fed gov, and we don't offer comprehensive medical care for Trans employees yet, unfortunately. Not everyone will be there yet. But it's important to ask.</em></p>
      <h3>Sign up and show your support!</h3>
      <p>I commit to asking employers about their LGBT EEO.<br><em>Add your name by <a href="https://github.com/lgbteeo/lgbteeo.github.io/edit/master/index.html">submitting a pull request</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lgbteeo/lgbteeo.github.io/issues/new">opening an issue</a>, or just tweeting at <a href="https://twitter.com/leahbannon">@leahbannon</a> and I'll add you.</em></p>
