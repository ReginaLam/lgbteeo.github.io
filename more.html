<h3>Looking for more?</h3>
<p>Interested in discussing this more? Not sure what to say? Think you have a better ask that we should consider? I'll keep track of people's responses here. Or you can <a href="https://github.com/lgbteeo/lgbteeo.github.io/issues/new">open an issue on GitHub</a> and start a discussion.</p>

<h3>Not everyone will be there yet. But it's important to ask.</h3>
<p>I'm intentionally not specific about what to say next, or what to actually <em>require</em> from employers. I would personally prefer to require all of this before promoting, but I work for the federal government, and we don't yet offer comprehensive medical care for Trans employees, unfortunately. So here's what I plan to say, depending on their response...</p>

<h3>What to say next</h3>
<p>My friend Brian suggested this, and I intend to use it. Feel free to share your ideas, suggested phrasing of the ask, etc.</p>
<p><strong>"I only promote [jobs] for companies that have a public statement of non-discrimination, and the policy must include LGBT rights. If you send me the link to that policy on your website, I'll be glad to promote this job in my networks. Thanks."</strong></p>
