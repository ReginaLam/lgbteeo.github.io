# How to add your name
First, thank you. Ok, now...

Create a new `[name].yml` file in the [_data/supporters](https://github.com/lgbteeo/lgbteeo.github.io/tree/master/_data/supporters) folder.

In that file, you can include 4 data fields (just copy and paste):
```
name:
descriptor:
twitter:
link:
```
Then submit that pull request!
